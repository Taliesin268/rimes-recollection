Scene: The Tent of Shallah

Narrator:
Thrall asks the Mouth how old the people of this place are. The Mouth offers to introduce him to one of the elders.

[Transition: Dancefloor → Path to the Elder’s Hut]
The music and laughter thin as they leave the celebration. A tent appears ahead, marked with ritual sigils, candles, incense, and wind-chimes. C’cillian — the one once invited into Thrall’s lamp — stands guard, casually eating berries. Chains and whips hang on him like ornaments.

C’cillian and the Mouth trade a few curious words in Reath that Thrall cannot understand. At the entrance, C’cillian gives Thrall a reassuring wink.

Immaculate furs line the threshold, pristine as new snow. Thrall is told he must walk in the presence of the elder — any magic nearby could be dangerous. They undergo a more thorough cleansing than before, body and spirit both, then approach the flap.

The Mouth:
“Their name is Shallah. They will be pleased to meet you.”

[Transition: Threshold → Inner Sanctum]
Narrator:
Inside: pillars, charcoal etchings, layered iconography. A shrine of tree-like supports cradles a loosely human head. Age droops every feature; bones knit together with the barest suggestion of a body, all of it clinging to a heart.

As Thrall steps in, he hears the dry crunch of eyelids prying open.

Thrall:
“How old are you?”

Narrator:
The elder rasps. The Mouth leans close to read lips and translate.

The Mouth:
“Shallah is forty-eight years old.”

Thrall:
“Is she comfortable?”

The Mouth:
“She does not have the means to be uncomfortable.”

Thrall:
“Must be nice… Wow, Mister Mouth, this one’s just for you. Is this getting worse for them?”

The Mouth:
“She will continue to worsen. This is what Risen’s bargain brought — to trade our bodies for our might.”

Thrall (to Shallah):
“Did your people agree?”

The Mouth (for Shallah):
“It has been the price of our safety and peace.”

Narrator:
Thrall watches, weighing whether the Mouth translates faithfully. The pause could be effort — or invention.

Thrall:
“Mister Mouth — do you agree with the decision?”

The Mouth:
“I am the voice of Risen. Of course. It was the only way to keep my children safe.”

Thrall:
“From what?”

The Mouth:
“From the other kingdoms.”

The Mouth:
“We have chosen to remove ourselves from the struggle of power.”

Thrall:
“Is it reversible? If you wanted to?”

The Mouth:
“It was a pact with our gods, and thus it would only be changeable should the gods decide.”

Thrall:
“If the rest of the world became friends, would you reverse this?”

The Mouth:
“If I were to rule Miltaur, the gods would see fit to reverse it.”

Thrall:
“So, if the ruler of Reath ruled Miltaur, it would be reversed?”

The Mouth:
“If Miltaur were united, it would be reversed.”

Thrall (to Shallah):
“Do you like your gods?”

Narrator:
Shallah stirs for the first time; with effort, remnants of muscle try to turn her head.

The Mouth (for Shallah):
“Shallah says the gods are. It is no matter of love or hate. You could no more hate the sun or the wind.”

Thrall:
“Why are the Reath gods different from the others?”

The Mouth:
“They are not. All gods are one. We worship them in a different form. The gods of Miltaur, of Zeterith, of the Serene Isles — they are the same. Known by different names, seen with different faces, worshipped in different ways.”

Thrall:
“I will go now. Tell Shallah I respect her greatly and want to help her.”

Narrator:
The Mouth translates. Shallah forces out a sound.

The Mouth:
“She asks that you stay a moment longer.”

Thrall:
“Did she want you to remain?”

The Mouth:
“No.”

Narrator:
The Mouth steps out and lets the curtain fall. Thrall lingers at the threshold, leaning in as Shallah gathers a final whisper.

Shallah (barely audible):
“Shar eular mialagra deshoon.”

[Transition: Tent → Dancefloor Arrival]
Narrator:
Thrall wheels around and sprints back to the dance floor, the drums and firelight rushing up to meet him.

Thrall (shouting):
“Shar eular mialagra deshoon! What does it mean?!”

Rime’s Echo Form (translating):
“My flesh burns the gods.”

Rime’s Echo Form:
“This is no passive devotion. It’s an invocation — a call for the gods themselves to walk upon Miltaur.”

Thrall’s Thoughts:
The tales said the Reath yielded their bodies for divine strength. But this sounds different: their flesh, their suffering, offered not merely as vessels… but as summoning.
